# whereFood
I'm sure that we are all aware of how prevalent food wastage is in Singapore.

From Mediacorp's nostalgic “Save my world” campaign to NEA's “Say YES to Waste Less” campaign, it's clear that sustainability is one of the causes championed by the government.

Based on the report by Towards Zero Waste Singapore, food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore and the amount of food waste generated has grown by around 20% over the last 10 years. It was also reported that Singapore generated around 744 million kg of food waste, which is equivalent to 2 bowls of rice per person per day in 2019.

Bearing this in mind, we realised just how commonplace food wastage is in our lives, and this inspired us to act.

What if F&B businesses could allow anyone to pick up the food they were going to discard?

# Eureka!

Thus, whereFood was born, with the aim of making the F&B industry more sustainable.

whereFood is a platform that matches the need of businesses to deal with excess food with the demand for food from the average Singaporean, who is looking for a quick fix.

## What it does
This is why we came up with whereFood to make the F&B industry a more sustainable one.
